Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

## ex00 - Polymorphism

about creating an Animal Base class. The Dog and Cat Class are derived classes of this Base Class. The Animal Class has a function makeSound which is overwritten in the derived classes so that each Class makes the appropriate animal sound. To test this we also implement a WrongAnimal and Wrong AnimalClass where the makeSound is not overwritten, which is why the WrongCat makes the WrongAnimal noise.
